There are two different approaches and mindsets that were discussed between the two videos. One of which discusses the desire to grow and the fear of failure, while the other talks about the way people take in content and are educated in an alternate way.

In the First video, carol (I think that is her name) talks alot about the developemental stage. The way children are raised has a huge impact on how they view learning in the future. She claims when kids are praised for their geniuss as a child doing simple tasks, they see the success as the goal. In later years this turns into a desire for success only and the hard part is is success is a challenge in a certain area, then the child will not pursue the challenge. The child is scared to fail and look stupid. Carol talks about all of these things in her keynote presentaion.

The guy who makes the interogating youtube videos talks about how misconceptions are things that need to be dealt with and he is there to help. In getting his phd he wrote about how physics content in videography. He discusses how making videos can help people be educated in a different way that can be entertaining.
